## Create necessary directories{-}
```{r create directories, eval=FALSE}
dir.create("./index")
dir.create("./RData")
dir.create("./tables")
dir.create("./figures")
```

# Counting the sgRNAs with RSubread{-}
To count the sgRNAs, we must first load the human GeCKO sgRNA library, and subsequently, convert it into the FASTA format to construct an index for alignment. To do that we use `DNAStringSet` and `writeXStringSet` functions from `GenomicAlignments` Bioconductor package.

```{r read sgRNA library}
GeCKO <- read.delim("sgRNA_library/GeCKOv21_Human.tsv")
GeCKO[1:2,]
sgRNAs <- DNAStringSet(GeCKO$seq)
names(sgRNAs) <- GeCKO$UID
sgRNAs
writeXStringSet(sgRNAs,
                file="./index/GeCKO.fa")
```

## Build an index{-}
Then we build an index of sgRNA library with `buildindex` function from `RSubread` package.
```{r build index, eval=FALSE}
buildindex("./index/GeCKO","./index/GeCKO.fa", 
           indexSplit=FALSE)
```

## Align the FASTQ files{-}
Next step is to align the sequencing files with `align` function from `RSubread` and count the reads with `readGAlignments` function in `GenomicAlignments`.

The subsequent phase involves aligning the sequencing files ([FASTQ files](https://github.com/goknurginer/Analysing-CRISPR-screens-with-edgeR/tree/main/fasqfiles)) using the `align` function from `RSubread` and counting the reads for each sgRNA using the `readGAlignments` function in `GenomicAlignments`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fastqs <- dir(path = "./fastq_files", pattern = "*.fastq.gz", full.names = TRUE)
counts <- list()
mapping_results <- list()
for(i in 1:length(fastqs)){
  mapping_results[[i]] <-align("./index/GeCKO",fastqs[i],output_file = gsub(".fastq.gz",".bam",fastqs[i]),
                  nthreads=4,unique=TRUE,nBestLocations=1,type = "DNA",TH1 = 1,
                  maxMismatches = 0,indels = 0)
  temp <- readGAlignments(gsub(".fastq.gz",".bam",fastqs[i]))
  counts[[i]] <- data.frame(table(seqnames(temp[width(temp) == "20"])),row.names = "Var1")
}
my_counts <- do.call(cbind,counts)
colnames(my_counts) <- c("Control_1","Control_2","ToxA_1","ToxA_2","ToxB_1","ToxB_2")
write.table(my_counts, "my_counts.txt")
```

## Create a DGEList object{-}
For downstream analysis, here we are going to convert count matrix obtained in the previous section into a DGEList object using the `DGEList` function from `edgeR` package. The DGEList object consists of three components: counts, information about samples and gene annotations. 
```{r create dgelist object}
counts <- read.table("my_counts.txt", header = TRUE)
group <- factor(c("Control","Control","ToxA","ToxA","ToxB","ToxB"),levels = c("Control","ToxA","ToxB"))
samples <- data.frame(group = group, sampleName=colnames(counts), biorep=rep(c(1,2),3))
genes <- GeCKO
names(genes)[names(genes)=="gene_id"] <- "Symbol"
d <- DGEList(counts = counts, samples = samples, genes = genes)
d
save(d, file="./RData/DGEList.RData")
```

# Preprocessing the data{-}
Before conducting the differential abundance analysis in a CRISPR screen, we eliminate guides that could compromise the statistical power in the downstream analysis. Specifically, we exclude non-targeting sgRNAs employed to assess the sgRNA library's quality, as they are unnecessary for the further statistical analysis. Subsequently, we filter out guides with very low counts across many samples.

The next step is normalization. The normalization following filtering is vital because each library is sequenced at varying depths, and libraries with higher counts will naturally yield higher counts. Normalization involves transforming raw counts onto a different scale where differences in library sizes are considered and adjusted for.
```{r load dgelist object}
load("./RData/DGEList.RData")
```

### Remove control guides{-}
First we remove 1000 control (non-targeting) sgRNAs from the count matrix as they are designed not to target in the genome.
```{r non-targeting filtering}
d.raw <- d
dim(d <- d[!d$genes$Symbol %in% grep("Non", d$genes$Symbol, value = TRUE),])
```

## Check guide distribution {-}
The control samples contain the majority of sgRNAs, and the numbers decrease in the treated samples.
```{r guide distribution,fig.width=10,fig.height=10}
data <- NULL
sample_names <- c(colnames(d),"GeCKO")
l <- c(as.integer(colSums(!d$counts==0)),nrow(d$counts))
t <- c(as.character(d$samples$group),"GeCKO")
data <- data.frame(row.name = sample_names, 
                   l=l,
                   t=t)
data <- data[order(data$l, data$t),]
col <- c("#FF6666","#6DAEB0", "#FAA578", "#FFB6C1")
my_bar <- barplot(data$l, 
                  xlim = c(0,140000),
                  names.arg = data$row.name,
                  las=1, 
                  space=1,
                  cex.names = 0.85,
                  xlab = "The number of detected guides",
                  main = "The distribution of guides",
                  col = col[as.factor(data$t)], 
                  border=NA,
                  legend=TRUE,
                  horiz = TRUE)
text(my_bar, x=data$l+7000 # adjust this number
     , paste0("n:", data$l),las = 2)
legend("bottomright",legend = levels(factor(data$t)),fill = col)
```

## Evaluate the uniformity{-}
The Gini index, originally an economic measure of inequality, is used in CRISPR analysis to evaluate the uniformity of sgRNA presence. A Gini index of 0 indicates evenness, while an index of 1 suggests unevenness. Here, it's notable that the control samples exhibit greater uniformity compared to the treated samples.
```{r gini}
gini(d$counts) 
boxplot(gini(d$counts) ~ d$samples$sampleName, ylab = "Gini Indices", xlab="", cex.axis=0.8)
```

## Remove lowly expressed guides{-}
Guides lacking a substantial number of reads in any sample should be excluded from downstream analyses. There are multiple rationales for this choice. From a biological perspective, guides that fail to register at a biologically relevant level in any condition are deemed uninteresting and are consequently disregarded. From a statistical standpoint, the elimination of guides with low counts enhances the reliability of estimating the mean-variance relationship in the data. It also reduces the number of statistical tests required for subsequent analyses focused on differential abundance.

To implement this, here we used two filtering methods: one permissive and the other strict. 

### Strict filtering{-}
For the strict approach, guides with low expression were filtered out, retaining as many guides as possible with meaningful counts. This was achieved using the `filterByExpr()` function in the `edgeR` package, a tool commonly applied in RNA-seq experiments for automated gene filtering. Initially, the count matrix contained 122,411 guides. After applying `filterByExpr()`, 113,395 guides (93%) were removed due to their low presence, leaving 9,016 guides for further analysis. It's worth noting that `filterByExpr()` often retains only one guide per gene, which is sub optimal for CRISPR screens, where the collective behavior of multiple guides targeting the same gene is essential for validation.
```{r strict filtering}
keep.exprs <- filterByExpr(d, group = d$samples$group)
table(keep.exprs)
dim(d.filtered.s <- d[keep.exprs, , keep.lib.sizes = FALSE])
```
```{r strict filtering guide distribution}
genes_sgrna <- d.filtered.s$genes$Symbol
length(unique(genes_sgrna))
nsgrna <- table(table(genes_sgrna))
nsgrna
barplot(nsgrna, col = "#FF9999", ylim=c(0,7000), border = NA, main="The distribution of number of sgRNAs per gene \n (After strict filtering)")
```


### Permissive filtering{-}
To address the limitations of strict filtering, we used a more permissive filtering approach. This method involved defining guide-wise threshold ($th1$) and sample-wise threshold ($th2$). We utilize CPM (Counts Per Million) values instead of raw counts to prevent bias toward samples with larger library sizes. For this dataset, the median library size is about $341,201$ and $th1$ is computed as $1e6/341201 â 0.29$, so the permissive filtering keeps the guides that have a CPM of 0.29 or more in at least $th2=2$ samples. 

This approach aims to strike a balance, allowing for the inclusion of as many guides as possible targeting the same gene, facilitating a more robust assessment of the collective impact of guides in CRISPR screens. Consequently, with the permissive approach, we retained $58171 (48\%)$ of the guides.

```{r permissive filtering}
th1 <- as.vector(cpm(1, median(d$samples$lib.size)))
th1 # median count per million reads (1e6/mean(d$samples$lib.size))
th2 <- 2 # average number of sample per condition
keep.exprs <- rowSums(cpm(d) > th1) >= th2
table(keep.exprs)
dim(d.filtered.p <- d[keep.exprs, ,keep.lib.sizes = FALSE])
```
```{r permissive filtering guide distribution}
genes_sgrna <- d.filtered.p$genes$Symbol
length(unique(genes_sgrna))
nsgrna <- table(table(genes_sgrna))
nsgrna
barplot(nsgrna, col = "#FF9999", ylim=c(0,7000), border = NA, main="The distribution of number of sgRNAs per gene \n (After permissive filtering)")
```

## Look at density plots{-}
The density distributions of raw counts reveal the presence of numerous guides with low abundance, characterized by small log-cpm values. The application of permissive filtering appears to diminish the count of such lowly abundant guides. This reduction is evident in the decreased peakedness (kurtosis) of the distribution, accompanied by a shift towards greater symmetry as indicated by the balanced skewness.
```{r density plots, fig.height=5, fig.width=15, echo=-49}
x <- d
nsamples <- ncol(x)
col.density <- brewer.pal(nsamples, "Paired")
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
samplenames <- colnames(x) 
cpm <- cpm(x)
lcpm <- cpm(x, log=TRUE)
plot(density(lcpm[,1],bw=0.4), col=col.density[1], lwd=2, ylim=c(0,1), las=2, main="", xlab="")
title(main="A. Raw data", xlab="Log-cpm")
for (i in 2:nsamples){
  den <- density(lcpm[,i],bw=0.4)
  lines(den$x, den$y, col=col.density[i], lwd=2)
}
legend("topright", samplenames, text.col=col.density, bty="n")

x <- d.filtered.p
cpm <- cpm(x)
lcpm <- cpm(x, log=TRUE)
plot(density(lcpm[,1],bw=0.4), col=col.density[1], lwd=2, ylim=c(0,1), las=2, main="", xlab="")
title(main="B. Permissively filtered data", xlab="Log-cpm")
for (i in 2:nsamples){
  den <- density(lcpm[,i],bw=0.4)
  lines(den$x, den$y, col=col.density[i], lwd=2)
}
legend("topright", samplenames, text.col=col.density, bty="n")

x <- d.filtered.s
cpm <- cpm(x)
lcpm <- cpm(x, log=TRUE)
plot(density(lcpm[,1],bw=0.4), col=col.density[1], lwd=2, ylim=c(0,1), las=2, main="", xlab="")
title(main="C. Strictly filtered data", xlab="Log-cpm")
for (i in 2:nsamples){
  den <- density(lcpm[,i])
  lines(den$x, den$y, col=col.density[i], lwd=2)
}
legend("topright", samplenames, text.col=col.density, bty="n")
# dev.off()
```

## Normalise the counts{-}
During sample preparation or sequencing, factors unrelated to biological processes can influence the expression of individual samples. The expectation is that all samples should exhibit a comparable range and distribution of expression values. To ensure uniformity across the entire experiment, normalization becomes necessary. Commonly, raw counts are transformed into a scale that accounts for differences in library sizes.

In our case, we first employed the `cpm` function in `edgeR` to transform raw counts into counts per million (CPM) and log2-counts per million (log-CPM) values. This transformation facilitates a standardized representation of expression values, enabling more meaningful comparisons across samples.

### CPM normalised counts {-}
```{r library sizes after filtering and CPM normalization, fig.width=15, fig.height=5}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
yy <- d[, order(d$samples$group, colSums(d$counts))]
yy.logcpm <- cpm(yy, log = T)
boxplot(yy.logcpm, las = 2, pch = 19, col = col[as.factor(yy$samples$group)], outcex = 0.3, outcol = col[as.factor(yy$samples$group)],labels = colnames(yy.logcpm), main = "A. CPM normalised raw data", ylab = "SgRNA representation (log2 cpm normalised reads)")
legend("topleft", legend = levels(factor(yy$samples$group)), col = col, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)

yy <- d.filtered.p[, order(d.filtered.p$samples$group, colSums(d.filtered.p$counts))]
yy.logcpm <- cpm(yy, log = T)
boxplot(yy.logcpm, las = 2, pch = 19, col = col[as.factor(yy$samples$group)], outcex = 0.3, outcol = col[as.factor(yy$samples$group)],labels = colnames(yy.logcpm), main = "B. CPM normalised permissively filtered data", ylab = "SgRNA representation (log2 cpm normalised reads)")
legend("topleft", legend = levels(factor(yy$samples$group)), col = col, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)

yy <- d.filtered.s[, order(d.filtered.s$samples$group, colSums(d.filtered.s$counts))]
yy.logcpm <- cpm(yy, log = T)
boxplot(yy.logcpm, las = 2, pch = 19, col = col[as.factor(yy$samples$group)], outcex = 0.3, outcol = col[as.factor(yy$samples$group)],labels = colnames(yy.logcpm), main = "C. CPM normalised strictly filtered data", ylab = "SgRNA representation (log2 cpm normalised reads)")
legend("topleft", legend = levels(factor(yy$samples$group)), col = col, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)
```

Following that, we implemented the `TMM` normalization using the `normLibSizes` function within the `edgeR` package. When dealing with DGEList objects, the normalization factors are automatically stored in the DGEList object. 

In the permissively filtered data, the influence of TMM normalization is modest, as suggested by the scaling factors, all of which are reasonably close to 1. However, notable is the fact that the normalization factors for ToxB samples are below one. This implies that a small number of highly abundant guide counts disproportionately influence the sequencing, causing counts for other genes to be lower than expected based on the library size. Consequently, the library size will be reduced, akin to scaling up the counts within that library. Such a scenario is typical in CRISPR screens.

To address this, introducing a prior value to the countsâsufficiently small to avoid altering the overall data distributionâserves to balance the library sizes, mitigating the impact of a few highly expressed guides.

### TMM normalised counts {-}

```{r library sizes after filtering and TMM normalization, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
yy <- d.filtered.p[, order(d.filtered.p$samples$group, colSums(d.filtered.p$counts))]
yy$samples$norm.factors <- normLibSizes(yy$counts, method = "TMM")
yy$samples[,1:3] # TMM normalization factors of permissively filtered data
yy.logcpm <- cpm(yy, log = T)

legend("topleft", legend = levels(factor(yy$samples$group)), col = col, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)

yy <- d.filtered.p[, order(d.filtered.p$samples$group, colSums(d.filtered.p$counts))]
yy$samples$norm.factors <- normLibSizes(yy$counts+100, method = "TMM")
yy$samples[,1:3] # TMM normalization factors of permissively filtered data after adding a prior count of 100
yy.logcpm <- cpm(yy, log = T)
boxplot(yy.logcpm, las = 2, pch = 19, col = col[as.factor(yy$samples$group)], outcex = 0.3, outcol = col[as.factor(yy$samples$group)],labels = colnames(yy.logcpm), main = "B. TMM offset-normalised permissively filtered data", ylab = "SgRNA representation (log2 cpm normalised reads)")
legend("topleft", legend = levels(factor(yy$samples$group)), col = col, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)
yy.norm <-yy # we continue downstream analysis with this object

yy <- d.filtered.s[, order(d.filtered.s$samples$group, colSums(d.filtered.s$counts))]
yy$samples$norm.factors <- normLibSizes(yy$counts, method = "TMM")
yy$samples[,1:3] # TMM normalization factors of strictly filtered data
yy.logcpm <- cpm(yy, log = T)
boxplot(yy.logcpm, las = 2, pch = 19, col = col[as.factor(yy$samples$group)], outcex = 0.3, outcol = col[as.factor(yy$samples$group)],labels = colnames(yy.logcpm), main = "C. TMM normalised strictly filtered data", ylab = "SgRNA representation (log2 cpm normalised reads)")
legend("topleft", legend = levels(factor(yy$samples$group)), col = col, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)

yy <- d.filtered.s[, order(d.filtered.s$samples$group, colSums(d.filtered.s$counts))]
yy$samples$norm.factors <- normLibSizes(yy$counts+100, method = "TMM")
yy$samples[,1:3] # TMM normalization factors of strictly filtered data after adding a prior count of 100
yy.logcpm <- cpm(yy, log = T)
boxplot(yy.logcpm, las = 2, pch = 19, col = col[as.factor(yy$samples$group)], outcex = 0.3, outcol = col[as.factor(yy$samples$group)],labels = colnames(yy.logcpm), main = "D. TMM offset-normalised strictly filtered data", ylab = "SgRNA representation (log2 cpm normalised reads)")
legend("topleft", legend = levels(factor(yy$samples$group)), col = col, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)
dev.off()
```

## Unsupervised clustering of samples {-}
A Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS) plot visually depicts the similarities and differences among samples in an unsupervised manner, providing a preliminary understanding of the potential for identifying differential abundance before formal testing. The leading fold-change is conventionally defined as the root-mean-square of the largest 500 log2-fold changes between sample pairs.

For this purpose, we utilize the `plotMDS` function from the `limma` package. It's worth noting that loading the `limma` package is redundant, as `edgeR` already includes and invokes its functions.

```{r mds plot normalization, fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
lcpm <- cpm(yy.norm, log=TRUE)
cols <- col
plotMDS(lcpm, col=cols[factor(yy.norm$samples$group)], main="MDS plot of permissevly filtered and TMM offset-normalised data", pch = 16, cex = 2)
legend("bottomright", legend=levels(factor(yy.norm$samples$group)), col = cols, pch = 16, cex=0.8)
```

We can see that the biological replicates of control and treated samples cluster well within the groups over dimension 1 and 2. The first dimension accounts for largest variability in the data. Then the larger the dimension, the lower the variation is. While samples exhibit grouping tendencies, there are significant abundance distinctions between control and treated samples. Consequently, we anticipate that when performing pairwise comparisons among control and treated samples, there will be a higher count of differentially abundant guides in comparisons.

## Visualise guide abundance profiles of samples{-}
A more detailed exploration of the normalization procedure applied to individual samples can be accomplished using mean-difference (MD) plots. In an MD plot, the library size-adjusted log-fold change between two libraries (the difference) is graphed against the average log-expression across those libraries (the mean). It is a good practice to look at MD plots for all samples for a quality check. We use `plotMD` from `edgeR` package to do that.
```{r volcano, fig.width=10, fig.height=15}
par(mfrow=c(3,2))
for(i in 1:6){
  plotMD(yy, column=i)
  abline(h=0, col="red", lty=2, lwd=2)
}
dev.off()
```

If the bulk of the counts are centered around the line of zero log-fold change. The diagonal lines in the  lower left of the plot correspond to genes with counts of 0, 1, 2 and so on in the first sample.

For a good quality, we expect he majority of the counts to be concentrated near the zero log-fold change line. However, this is hardly ever the case for CRISPR experiments due to the sparse nature of CRISPR screen counts. The diagonal lines in the lower-left portion of the plot correspond to guides with counts of very low numbers. And it is typical for treated samples to observe a positive skew, with a number of very highly upregulated guides in the upper right of the plots. These points correspond to  the guides that are both highly abundant and highly up-regulated in the given sample compared to others. Especially ToxB samples are more positively skewed than ToxA samples. These guides also explain why the normalization factor for ToxB samples were well below one before adding an offset. By contrast, the log-ratios for control samples were somewhat negatively skewed,  corresponding to their normalization factor above one.
Although we used TMM normalization with an added offset to the counts, a more specialized normalization methods are needed for accurate CRISPR screen analyses.

# Differential abundance analysis at guide level{-}
Differential abundance analysis in the context of CRISPR typically refers to the identification of significant differences in the abundance of sgRNAs between different experimental conditions or sample groups. Empirical analysis of Digital Gene Expression `edgeR` is one of the most widely used Bioconductor packages designed for the analysis of differential gene expression in RNA-seq data.

Here, we harness the robust capabilities of edgeR for differential expression analysis to precisely identify those sgRNAs that have a significant impact on the phenotype under investigation. 

edgeR offers two distinct pipelines: the classic edgeR and the glm (generalized linear model) edgeR.

**1. Classic edgeR:** This pipelin is based on `exactTest` function and it can be used when there is no biological replicates in any condition.

**2. edgeR glm (Generalized Linear Model):** This pipeline splits into two distinct approaches with stricter error rate than classic edgeR:

**a. edgeR glmLRT (Generalized Linear Model Likelihood Ratio Test):** This approach relies on negative binomial generalized linear models, and the test employed is the Likelihood Ratio Test. This method ensures a more stringent control over the error rate compared to classic edgeR.

**b. edgeR quasi glmQLFTest (Generalized Linear Model Quasi-Likelihood F-test):** In this statistical methodology, negative binomial generalized linear models are employed, featuring F-tests instead of likelihood ratio tests. This pipeline is also controls the error rate better than classic edgeR, additionally edgeR-quasi excels in low-count situations.

## Create the design matrix{-}
For further statistical modeling using edgeR, we now need to define a design matrix containing the factors in the experiment. 
```{r design}
design <- model.matrix(~group, data = yy.norm$samples)
design
```

## Fit a model when there is no biological replicates{-}
While it's generally advisable to include biological replicates in experimental designs for statistical rigor and robust conclusions, there may be situations in CRISPR screens where researchers choose not to include them initially, especially in exploratory phases. The decision often involves a trade-off between the depth of analysis and the available resources. However, as the study progresses and findings are prioritized, additional experiments with biological replicates are often conducted to validate and strengthen the results. In instances where biological replicates are unavailable, they are not ideal but classic edgeR provides two alternative solutions: one involves the `exactTest`, and the other employs the Generalized Linear Model Likelihood Ratio Test (`glmLRT`). In such scenarios, a crucial step is to determine a sensible estimate for common Biological Coefficient of Variation (BCV). However, the p-values will heavily depend on the initial BCV estimate. This BCV estimate is utilized and the statistical model is conducted as follows:

### Classic edgeR{-}
Here we subset only one biological replicate of each condition.
```{r no biorep exact test, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
bcv <- 0.6
yy.norm.no_biorep <- DGEList(counts = yy.norm$counts[,c(2,4,6)], samples= yy.norm$samples[c(2,4,6),], genes = yy.norm$genes)
et.toxb <- exactTest(yy.norm.no_biorep, dispersion=bcv^2,pair = c(1,3))
et.toxa <- exactTest(yy.norm.no_biorep, dispersion=bcv^2,pair = c(1,2))
head(topTags(et.toxb,n=Inf))
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plotMD(et.toxb)
plotMD(et.toxa)
dev.off()
write.csv(et.toxa, file = paste0("./tables/",Sys.Date(),"Classic_edgeR-ToxAvsCtrl-DE-sgRNAs.csv"))
write.csv(et.toxb, file = paste0("./tables/",Sys.Date(),"Classic_edgeR-ToxBvsCtrl-DE-sgRNAs.csv"))
```

### edgeR glmLRT{-}
```{r no biorep glm, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
fit <- glmFit(yy.norm.no_biorep, dispersion=bcv^2)
lrt.toxa <- glmLRT(fit, coef = "y$samples$groupToxA")
lrt.toxb <- glmLRT(fit, coef = "y$samples$groupToxB")
topTags(lrt.toxa)
topTags(lrt.toxb)
plotMD(lrt.toxa, main="ToxA vs Control")
abline(h=c(-3, 3), col="blue")
plotMD(lrt.toxb, main="ToxB vs Control")
abline(h=c(-3, 3), col="blue")
dev.off()
lrt.toxa$table$Symbol <- lrt.toxa$genes$Symbol
lrt.toxb$table$Symbol <- lrt.toxb$genes$Symbol
write.csv(lrt.toxa$table, file = paste0("./tables/",Sys.Date(),"edgeR_glmLRT-ToxAvsCtrl-DE-sgRNAs.csv"))
write.csv(lrt.toxb$table, file = paste0("./tables/",Sys.Date(),"edgeR_glmLRT-ToxBvsCtrl-DE-sgRNAs.csv"))
datatable(format(lrt.toxa$table[order(lrt.toxb$table$PValue, decreasing = FALSE),],format="e", digits=3))
datatable(format(lrt.toxb$table[order(lrt.toxb$table$PValue, decreasing = FALSE),],format="e", digits=3))
```

## Fit a model when there are biological replicates{-}
When there are a minimum of two biological replicates for each condition under consideration, the edgeR glm method performs better than classic edgeR in CRISPR experiments. To employ edgeR glm, it's essential to estimate the dispersion parameter of the negative binomial (NB) distribution. This parameter is crucial as it accommodates the variability observed between biological replicates.


### Dispersion estimates and biological variation{-}
These estimates can be visualized with `plotBCV` function from `edgeR`.
```{r bcv}
yy.norm <- estimateDisp(yy.norm, design)
yy.norm$common.dispersion
bcv <- sqrt(yy.norm$common.dispersion)
bcv
plotBCV(yy.norm)
```
BCV is computed as the square root of common dispersion, which is 0.8 (larger than 0.3) in this experiment. This is high considering that genetically identical cells are used to deign the experiment. The trended dispersion shows that when the abundance gets higher, the variation decreases. At low logCPM, the dispersion is very large. 

### edgeR glmLRT{-}
```{r dea glmLRT}
fit <- glmFit(yy.norm, design)
lrt <- glmLRT(fit, coef = "groupToxA")
lrt2.toxa <- topTags(lrt, n = Inf, sort.by = "PValue")$table
lrt <- glmLRT(fit, coef = "groupToxB")
lrt2.toxb <- topTags(lrt, n = Inf, sort.by = "PValue")$table
datatable(format(lrt2.toxa[order(lrt2.toxa$FDR, decreasing = FALSE),],format="e", digits=3))
write.csv(lrt2.toxa, file = paste0("./tables/",Sys.Date(),"-edgeR_glmLRT-with_biorep-ToxAvsCtrl-DE-sgRNAs.csv"))
write.csv(lrt2.toxb, file = paste0("./tables/",Sys.Date(),"-edgeR_glmLRT-with_biorep-ToxBvsCtrl-DE-sgRNAs.csv"))
```
### edgeR quasi{-}
Both edgeR glm and edgeR quasi are viable options. So next we will  continue analyzing the given example using edgeR quasi. It's important to note that, under the quasi-likelihood (QL) pipeline, only the trended dispersion is utilized, not The tagwise and common estimates. The QL dispersions can be estimated by utilizing the `glmQLFit` function and subsequently visualized using the `plotQLDisp` function. Also note that the results of this pipeline can be quite conservative and as shown below, there mey be only a few or no significant hit can be detected.

Both edgeR glm and edgeR quasi are feasible choices. Therefore, we will proceed with the analysis of the provided example using edgeR quasi. It's crucial to highlight that, within the quasi-likelihood (QL) pipeline, only the trended dispersion is employed, not the tagwise and common estimates. The QL dispersions can be estimated using the `glmQLFit` function and visualized through the `plotQLDisp` function. A graphical representation with `plotQLDisp` below depicts the quarter-root QL dispersion plotted against the average abundance of each gene. The estimates are presented for the raw dispersions (pre-empirical Bayes moderation), trended dispersions, and squeezed dispersions (post-empirical Bayes moderation). Additionally, it's worth noting that the outcomes of this pipeline can be conservative, as demonstrated below, where only a few or no significant hits may be detected.
```{r edger quasi}
fit <- glmQLFit(yy.norm, design, robust=TRUE)
plotQLDisp(fit)
qlf.toxa <- glmQLFTest(fit, coef = "groupToxA")
qlf2.toxa <- topTags(qlf.toxa, n = Inf, sort.by = "PValue")$table
datatable(format(qlf2.toxa[order(qlf2.toxa$FDR, decreasing = FALSE),],format="e", digits=3))
write.csv(qlf.toxa, file = paste0("./tables/",Sys.Date(),"-edgeR_glmQLF-with_biorep-ToxAvsCtrl-DE-sgRNAs.csv"))
qlf.toxb <- glmQLFTest(fit, coef = "groupToxB")
qlf2.toxb <- topTags(qlf.toxb, n = Inf, sort.by = "PValue")$table
datatable(format(qlf2.toxb[order(qlf2.toxb$FDR, decreasing = FALSE),],format="e", digits=3))
write.csv(qlf.toxb, file = paste0("./tables/",Sys.Date(),"-edgeR_glmQLF-with_biorep-ToxBvsCtrl-DE-sgRNAs.csv"))
```

# Visualise hit guides{-}
A volcano plot is a scatter plot that visualizes the differential abundance of guides. The fold change is typically displayed on the x-axis, while the y-axis represents the corresponding p-values. The significantly differentially abundant genes are the ones found in the upper-left and upper-right corners. Below we visualise the hits for ToxA vs Control and ToxB vs Control samples, respectively.
